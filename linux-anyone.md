We've had a Dell Inspiron laptop knocking around for a couple of years now and I've never known what to do with it.

One time I tried installing Batocera and then ChimeraOS on it to use as a console in the living room but got bored with the fiddling and it wasn't a good set up anyway.

I've recently come across ZorinOS and liked the look of it. It has been suggested for people moving from Windows, but ironically I found it more macos-like - especially after a few UI tweaks.

My daily driver is an M3 iMac and I use an old MacBook Air for some home server stuff, and when I need it I can use the Air for some dev work. It's a slow machine though and I don't like using it for that.

I'm hoping if I need to do work away from my desk now I can use this laptop instead.

Here's my desktop with Mac-style tweaks:
