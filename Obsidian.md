I started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) a few months ago, after first moving to Quillpad from Google Notes when I decided to de-Google. It is a pretty powerful editor and note taker but I hadn't really looked into what it could do until I saw a post on Mastodon about using it to edit posts in Eleventy. Neat!

This is basically a test post to see if I can use Obsidian as a CMS. Let's see if it works.

**Update: it works!**
