I just read [this post](https://mxb.dev/blog/the-indieweb-for-everyone/) by [@mxbck@front-end.social](https://front-end.social/@mxbck). 

This is an older one but there are a lot of posts like this popping up and it's exactly how I feel about the internet now.

What worries me with saying
> Maybe we need some of that early internet vibe back and be ok with smaller, closer communities.
is how long will it be until people don't remember the early internet? 

I've been building for the web for 25 years (and that's not even the early early days), but a lot of people only know social media like Twitter and Facebook. Do people still tinker?

I used to mess with my brother's Amiga 500, then it became mine and I messed with the settings, found weird programs I had no idea what they did, made crappy pixel art in Deluxe Paint, played Monkey Island and even had a crack at making my own point-and-click games with [GRAC](https://amiga.abime.net/games/view/grac-graphic-adventure-creator-version-2).

Do people still do this? I dunno. You can't tinker with Tiktok, or an iPad. Everything is designed for users to use.

Anyway, I don't know where I'm going with this so I'll wrap it up. Still, when will people forget the old internet? I hope they don't, I hope it sticks around and massive social media platforms disappear.
