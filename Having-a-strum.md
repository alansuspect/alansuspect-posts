Something happened today.

I actually picked up a guitar and made up some new music. It wasn't much, just a few riffs but it's been so long. I'm just constantly working and don't put time aside for my activities.

And it was on bass. I bought a Fender p-bass a long, long time ago and hardly ever play it. I'm a guitarist by trade but it always seemed like a neat thing to have, especially if I want to record anything.

I also recorded it on my phone as I will very likely forget it, which is pretty cool. I remember when I was young I had a MiniDisc recorder to record demo tracks, and later audio software like Cubase. I used Cubase to record Suspect Package's [first (and only) album](https://sectionfiverecords.bandcamp.com/album/suspect-package).

But it was nice to just feel free to play something today. Maybe I'll keep doing it. I should keep doing it.
