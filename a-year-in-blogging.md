Well I did it, I've officially had an active blog for a year now.

I think it's the longest I've ever kept a blog going - and at 14 posts I'm not exactly winning any records - but sticking to things isn't my fort√© so I'm pretty chuffed with myself.

Looking back, I've enjoyed playing with Eleventy (more to come on that in future posts); discovering [itch.io](http://itch.io) and all the amazing games on there; and also finding bitsy and making several fun games.

So here's to the next year, and seeing what else I can add to this site.
