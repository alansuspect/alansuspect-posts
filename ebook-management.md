I have an old MacBook Air 13" from 2019 which was my work horse for a while until I forked out for a new iMac last year. It comes in handy sometimes when I need to do work away from my desk but it's pretty slow so that's mostly limited to simple coding stuff.

Recently I've been adding self-hosting platforms to it - namely Jellyfin and other media-related treats.

A while back I came across Kavita, an ebook organisation platform in a similar vein to Jellyfin but for ebooks. I keep all my ebooks in a folder and occasionally sort through them using [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com), which is great for tweaking metadata and all that.

I sync my local files with [MEGA.io](https://MEGA.io) so everything is backed up, and I also share the local MEGA folder (the main sync is on my iMac) with the MacBook Air so it can access all the files. This is handy for both coding and ebook management.

So I've set Kavita up now and it has imported all my books. Some of the metadata is off so I'll need to do some tidying up in Calibre, but so far so good. I also set up the email-to-device config so if I add new ebooks to Kavita first I can then send them to my Kindle. Easy!
