I was watching the news this morning and they were talking about Green Day and the new 'dynamic pricing' for gig tickets being used, which basically means if more people are trying to book tickets the price will go up.

It's not just Green Day either, it's the ticket companies pushing the feature.

It's a horrific capitalism invention and all I can say is people should go check out local bands instead. This is just making nice things available only to the rich.

My question is, why can't we make these ticket companies pay a tax that goes towards local music/art investment?

This was done with Netflix; they have to commit to making a certain amount of Aussie content per year. If you're taking money from people to go see major foreign acts, some of that should be reinvested.

I hate capitalism, it ruins nice things.
