Is there a flat-file CMS I could point to my Eleventy dev folder that would act as a nice front end to manage the Markdown content?

I've looked at a few (such as Grav, TinaCMS, Pico CMS, SpinalCMS) but they seem to do their own thing and manage files/site themselves, whereas I'd want Eleventy to handle everything and just have a nice UI instead of dealing with files.

The idea being when you save a post/page (.md file) it would update the e.g. GitHub repo and trigger the build. Any ideas?

Bonus points for being open source and also an accommodating free plan, or at least decent upgrade levels that don't go from free to $500 pm for an additional seat.

[Mattrbld](https://mattrbld.com) looks good but I'm not sure how mature/stable it is and so does [PagesCMS](https://pagescms.org/) if it can do what I'm after. I guess it also depends on hosting and my options there too.
