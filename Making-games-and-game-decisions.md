I have had this idea for a computer game for a while now, it's not completely fleshed out but I have a rough storyline down and a few ideas for puzzles.

What I can't decide on is how to implement it. Issues of time aside, I'm also not a skilled game developer so an easy learning curve would be preferable.

I like doing pixel art so that would be a nice path to go down, but I probably shouldn't commit to doing too much of it as I'll end up giving up before I get anywhere.

My first thought is a point-and-click adventure game like LucasArts used to make. When I was a kid I played with GRAC on the Amiga and I can see similar programs exist now, such as Escoria and Popochiu add-ons to Godot.

I even got sidetracked looking at Godot add-ons and found Cogito. For a brief moment considered a first person puzzler, but have no idea about 3D graphics.

Going to the far end on the other side I thought about doing an interactive fiction piece, where the story and puzzles would be a lot easier to implement and I could incorporate some static pixel art along the way.

Lastly I've been trying out some games on the iPad which are kind of a mix of interactive fiction and point and click, in fact they call themselves point and click games but I consider them more *first person* point and click, for clarity.

I even found an add-on for Godot called EgoVenture which does this kind of thing. It would mean I can do static graphics (without all the pesky animating characters walking stuff) and keep things as simple or complex as I like. On top of that, I could implement some cool puzzles.

Oh, and a bonus mention to GBStudio which looks awesome, but not sure it would suit my game style. Maybe for another project.

Lots of coulds in there! How do other people figure out how to plan a project like this? Do you do a script/plan layout or just get started and figure it out as you go?
