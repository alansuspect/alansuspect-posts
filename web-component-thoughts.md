I keep coming back to reading about web components.

The opportunity to try them out hasn't come up yet but I still don't think I get it. Is it just another way of sneaking JavaScript into a site build? Do they work without JavaScript?

With all the Eleventy talk about moving to Font Awesome and their Web Awesome stuff I really want to learn it and like it, but I'm coming at it from an HTML/CSS-only standpoint (static sites lend themselves to a lack of JS) and am trying to understand how it carefully adds to a build, instead of taking it over or relying on JS. Or maybe I'm way off.

For several years now I've used "builders" for some clients, mostly on WordPress, which are a swamp of JavaScript and awful performance. So as I look to simpler project builds in the future I want to factor in nice solutions for things that aren't going to turn into a hassle down the line.

The idea of browsers supporting it sounds fantastic though. Maybe I'll figure it out one day.
