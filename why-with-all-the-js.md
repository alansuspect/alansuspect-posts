I'm not great at JavaScript. Never have, never will, and I'm ok with that. I understand enough and can follow many others' leads to do what I want with it. 

Or, even better, just not use it. I grew up with HTML, then added CSS along the way. That was always enough.

At one point I had this stomach-dropping feeling that I may need to learn React to keep doing my job. That meant learning React AND JavaScript. No thanks.

Now I see several articles, posts, and mentions a week about how over-reliance on JS is damaging user experience, how it is creating a pointless situation when things could be much simpler.

And I'm glad. It wasn't the way things were going after all, just the way some people thought it should and we all got swept up along the way.

Some of the tools I use in my day-to-day website building activities are very JS-heavy, and it is starting to show. Simple web builders are now bloated to the point they can't perform their basic functions without difficulties (and let's not get started on the shoe-horned AI obsession).

Now I just need to convince my clients they don't need all the bells and whistles!
